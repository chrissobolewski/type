    twitter: Quick Coffe is not an iPad blog, but it starts with an iPad-focused post
---

Let’s get this out of the way first. This is not an iPad blog. There will be iPad-related entries here (this is one of them), sure, but I plan to cover a much wider array of topics in general. So probably, this is not the best introduction to Quick Coffee. 

But it’s something I need to get out of my system.

See, I use iPad quite often. I’m not iPad-only by any means. Far from that. But after work, I consider myself iPad-primarily or iPad-first (having *constant* problems with my family iMac is helping a lot with that).

I have fun on the iPad. And by that I don’t only mean *entertainment*, as such. Even though, iPad used to be (and by many, it still is) considered a content consumption device, first and foremost. But apart from that, I have fun by writing on the iPad. By trying out new apps and experimenting with new setups. By programming - if you can call it that - simple and less-simple workflows in the Shortcuts app. 

But then, [it’s easy to dismiss](https://www.nubero.ch/blog/005/) all those elaborate scripts and workflows as futile attempts at making iPad more like a traditional laptop.

But I don’t think it’s the case here. I don’t want a laptop. I want a device that adapts to me. 

- Taking notes - use a stylus
- Writing a blog post - use a keyboard
- Watching a movie in bed - detach the keyboard
- Going through my to-do list - tap the screen, use gestures

iPad is by far the computing device that gives me most joy. Computer - whether it’s my Windows PC at work or iMac at home - is for work. It’s for heavy lifting. It’s not a *pick up when I feel like it* device. Sometimes, it almost feels like I have to make an appointment with my iMac to use it. I need to be in a special state of mind. "Now I’m using the computer" mode.

iPhone - it’s a necessity. And often a nuance. A distraction. Filler of free time. It’s the device that pings me when someone wants something from me. Thief of attention, bringer of work.

But the iPad - it’s the the device I go to when I want some time for myself. When I want to work on *my* things, *my* projects.

And I want more of it. I want to spend more time with it. I am perfectly aware that it can’t do many things my computer can with ease. But I will push it. I will try to bend it to my will. Not without effort.

I will build elaborate shortcuts to perform seemingly easy things, such as downloading files, even [at the risk of looking silly](https://twitter.com/OhMDee/status/1130992230901043200). Because it will allow me to spend more time on the device I like. And less time on devices that scream "work!" or "look at me!"
